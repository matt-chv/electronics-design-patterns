Solenoid valve is used to control electrically the flow of fluids. The plunger (the moving part) is held back by a spring and will be activated by the EMF force generated when the coil is energised either by a current or by a voltage.

F the force-stroke of the plunger is determined by electro mechanical build (alpha and beta) and by the current (i)

The plunger will start moving once F overcomes static friction and stops moving when hitting the damper.

$$F=\frac{i_0^2}{2}*\frac{-\beta}{(\alpha+\beta*x)^2}$$
