# Electronics Design Pattern

While the SW world has enjoyed Design Pattern for many years, finding a good list of those for electronics is not an easy task.

This project aims at:
* taxonomy: power, signal chain, sensors&actuators, timing and logic
* provide a simple electronic diagram and explanation
* then provide in a second phase deeper details on each of those diagrams
