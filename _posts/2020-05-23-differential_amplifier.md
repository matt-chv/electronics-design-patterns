# Differential Amplifier

A differential amplifier, amplifies the difference of voltages between its inputs. When R4/R1=R1/R3:

$$ V_{OUT} = -\frac{R4}{R2} * (V_{IN+}-V_{IN-} $$

Notes:
differential amplifier vs difference amplifier, settling for wikipedia naming [differential amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_amplifier)
