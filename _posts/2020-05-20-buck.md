# Buck Regulator

A buck regulator is a type of switching regulator, a highly efficient
means of producing a regulated DC voltage or current from a
higher input voltage. With the switch on, current flows through the
inductor I1, charging the output capacitor C1. When the switch
turns off, the diode D1 completes the circuit with the inductor,
applying a voltage of the opposite polarity to the inductor, and
causing the current to linearly decrease. A feedback loop adjusts
the duty cycle or frequency of the switch SW1 in order to maintain
a constant output voltage on the output capacitor.

$$ Vout = \frac{t_{on}}{t_{on}+t_{off}} * Vin $$
