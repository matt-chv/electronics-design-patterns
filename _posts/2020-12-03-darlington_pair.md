A Darlington pair is used to offer a very high current gain even with low base current. Darlington configuration was invented by Sidney Darlington in the year of 1953. It is similar to the [sziklai pair]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-12-03-sziklai_pair %}) but uses two NPN and has a 1.2V activation voltage.

$$ I_C= I_B * (\beta_1 * \beta_2) $$
