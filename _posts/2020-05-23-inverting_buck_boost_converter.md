# Inverting Buck-Boost Converter

A buck-boost converter is an inductor based switching regulator whose output voltage can be lower or higher than the input voltage.

Besides the implementation in this schematic, another topology called [four switch buck-boost converter]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-05-23-four_switch_buck_boost_converter %})

$$ Vout = \frac{-D}{1-D} * Vin $$
