A flyback diode is used to protect electronics from the voltage spikes generated when an inductive load such as a motor, a valve or a relay, is disconnected. 
Disconnecting current path to an inductor generates a voltage spike of the opposite polarity, and a flyback diode absorbs this, protecting the driving electronics.
