PCB (Printed Circuit Board) provides mechanical support and electric interconnections for  components (such as `Integrated Circuits`, passive components and connectors) to be combined into an electronic system.

??? Note on PCB vs board

    PCB can be often referenced to as `board` and such are illustrated here: https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/iPhone/Boards

??? Note on PCB vs PCBA
    `PCB` sometimes refer to the board (i.e. purely mechanical support and electrical interconnections) without assembled components as opposed to `PCBA` (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) which refers to the finished board after all the components have been installed and soldered on a printed circuit board (PCB).

??? Note on PCB vs system
    An electronic system usually requires a PCB to be assembled inside a mechanical casing and optionnally before this, assembly with other electronic systems to provide the desired functionality. Usual examples of such multi board assembly in a mechanical casing include but are not limited to:
        * mobile phones, such as illustrated on [ifixit](https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/iPhone/Boards)
        * TV
        * tablet
        * smart watch
        * gaming console
        * Smart home device

considerations
    * top-down: what it is used for (consumer electronics, power electronics, RF, ... - and how the application needs drive the design/manufacturing of the PCB
    * bottom-up: how it is built - and how those aspects impact the end application


## BOTTOM-UP

a PCB is a sandwitched layers of core, prepreg and copper.

core is cured, prepreg is not cured, copper is attached via prepreg tot the core to provide electrical connections.

## copper/epoxy

describes how copper roughness and oxydation process are necessary for binding copper layer to prepreg

how to make a pcb

1. pre-production
1.1 Engineering
    link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrrtBuD3N3w&list=PLpkRvleEgaPY3uwrGmCb3VvUP8d_jR52B&index=2
    key notes: 
        1. pre-production
            a. generate tools and working files from gerber data
                * program for drilling positions
            b. check files
                * holes files align with drawings

        2. inner layer

Cores are basically made up of prepregs and copper foils that have been laminated and cured.
Inner layer sheets are cut in the right size for panels
        

1.2 material issue

2. inner layer
    2.1 inner layer image transfer

photosensitive film added on top of copper
then masks from gerber are applied and UV light shon on it (or laser engraved)

    2.2 develop etch strip

then removed the polymereised photosensitive film which exposes copper
which is then removed
then the polymer is removed (stripping)

    2.3 AOI

3. lamination

3.1 oxyde layer

oxydise the top layer to allow bounding to next layer prepreg

3.2 lay up

@00:16
For multi-layer PCB the above is repeated:
a. take a core
b. sandwidth it with copper + prepreg either side (copper + prepreg + core + prepreg + core + prepreg + copper)
c. press between metal plates (@01:17)


3.3 bonding

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnzNrmoLnik&list=PLpkRvleEgaPY3uwrGmCb3VvUP8d_jR52B&index=9
@00:35

the stack goes into the lamination press where it is hot-pressed with specific pressure and temperature based on desired build and types of materials used. The resin in the prepreg melts and will gule the prepreg to both the inner layer cores and the copper foils 

Then transferred to a cold pressing to cool down noting that a slow and controlled cooling is important to avoid bow and twist of the panel. Once cooled the resin is cured and and the multi-layer stack is stable

!!! note
    After lamination tooling goes for a cleaning as lamination is a critical step of multilayer production

4. drilling
4.1 x-ray drilling tooling holes
4.2 mechanical drilling

via holes (create electrical connections between layers)
solder through holes (mounting components)
non plated holes (mechanical alignement)

>The name FR4 comes from the NEMU grading system where the ‘FR’ stands for ‘fire retardant’, compliant with the UL94V-0 standard. You may have noticed that on the Seeed Fusion order page the FR4 option is followed by TG130. The TG refers to the transition glass temperature – the temperature at which the glass-reinforced material will start to deform and soften. For Fusion’s standard boards this value is 130°C, which is more than enough for most applications. Special High TG materials can withstand temperatures of 170 – 180°C and can be ordered online using the Advanced PCB service.

Most FR4 laminates owe their flame resistance to its bromine content, a non-reactive halogen commonly used in industries for its flame retarding properties. This gives FR4 materials obvious advantages as a stock PCB material in terms of fire safety while in the field. It is also a little reassuring if your soldering skills are not up to standard.

However, bromine is a halogen which are highly toxic chemicals that are released in the environment when the material is incinerated. Even small amounts are sufficient to cause serious harm to humans or even death. To reduce the use of such hazardous substances in our everyday products, halogen-free FR4 laminates are readily available.

> Laminates are made out of a fiberglass woven contruction and a resin. There are 3 kinds of fiberglass (E , NE and S) , each with their own specific dielectric properties and applications.

> The difference sits in the construction of the weave. ( how many strands per bundle , individual strand thickness , how tightly bundles are woven, how individal mats are stacked and what resin is used)

> Prepreg is a laminate that is not fully cured. The fiberglass mat is impregnated with a resin that is half cured so it can be manipulated. if you re-heat it it will melt again. Only if you bring the resin above a certain temperature (the Tg temperature , also called the Glass Transition temperature ) will it solidify completely . ( there is also Td : decomposition. bring it above that and it starts falling apart ... )

> The copper is bonded by chemically oxidizing the copper foil. They use a process that grows a copper oxide. that stuff is porous enough so that , during lamination , it will bond tightly with the resin.

# Glossary

B-stage: All prepreg are B-stage material
core is a product of the prepreg and lamination. It is therefore far more rigid compared to the prepreg. The core is made up of a fiberglass-epoxy laminate which is Flame Retardant and has copper on either side.
Prepreg: On the other hand is partially dried without lamination and isn’t as rigid as the core
glass fiber: molten glass pushed through small holes to make strands which are then woven (https://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Fiberglass.html)
substrate: the material on whose surface copper and/or circuits are assembled. For PCB, these can be either:
    * paper (for FR-1 and FR-2) with epoxy
    * glass epoxy (for FR-4) or glass resine
    * glass composite
    * Teflon or PTFB (can be reinforced with glass or ceramic ) - list of suppliers (https://www.pcbonline.com/blog/teflon-pcb.html)
    * Alumina
    * LTCC Substrate (Low-temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) is a PCB substrate used for multi-layer boards. As aluminum oxide needs to be baked at a high temperature of 1500°C, it is not possible to perform simultaneous baking with a wiring pattern using low melting point copper. By adding glass-based materials to aluminum oxide, LTCC substrates can be fired at temperatures as low as 900°C.)
