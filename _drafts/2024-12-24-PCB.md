PCB: Printed circuit board is the mechanical support and electronic interconnection between ICs.

it is made of pre-preg + copper

    key notes: 
        1. pre-production
            a. generate tools and working files from gerber data
                * program for drilling positions
            b. check files
                * holes files align with drawings

        2. inner layer
